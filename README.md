# acled_api

This Rust crate provides an easier way interacting with the [ACLED API](https://apidocs.acleddata.com/)
for armed conflict location and event data. The data is provided by the [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/) NGO.

**Note: Access to this API requires a private API key**

This crate is not under active development, but we accept improvements.
